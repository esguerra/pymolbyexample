# Molecular Movies and Stills with Pymol #
This repository contains scripts used as examples of the image and movie making
capabilities of pymol from a class on molecular visualization by David van der Spoel at
Uppsala University in the first semester of 2017.

The examples can be updated by anyone wishing to do so by forking the repo and opening 
a pull request.

The examples can be run nowadays using pymol packaged in a conda environment. 
An example of such use in a computer cluster using the SLURM queueing program
can be seen in the argonaute2 folder file run.sl

Some examples were developed by Mauricio Esguerra and Benjamin Schroeder.  

An additional example we think was useful for the class can be found in the pymolwiki at:
