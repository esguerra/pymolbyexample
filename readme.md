# Molecular Movies and Stills with Pymol #
This repository contains scripts used as examples of the image and movie making
capabilities of pymol from a class on molecular visualization by David van der Spoel at
Uppsala University in the first semester of 2017.   

Some examples were developed by Mauricio Esguerra and Benjamin Schroeder.  

An additional example we think was useful for the class can be found in the pymolwiki at:
